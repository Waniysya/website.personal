  <p>My name is Norshazwani Binti Mat Nor. I am 20 years old. I have five sibling and I'm  the second one. I'm student from UITM Machang Kelantan in Diploma of Information Management in last semester. My goals is to be a successful woman in life. My current hobby is reading. Among the reading materials I chose were novels, magazines, and fiction books. I love reading because I get satisfaction when reading. In addition, I really like surfing the internet and reading to gather information about professional careers that I may be involved in later. I want to know more about a career before venturing into it so that I will be able to make decisions according to my interests. </p>
